Exam project in my frontend elective on Multimedia design  
Case: Make a dynamic dashboard with data from a Web API

Subject: Frontend  
Year: 2018  
Tools: HTML, CSS/SCSS, Javascript, jQuery, SVG, Git, Npm     

## Detailed description

In my Frontend elective, we had to develop a dashboard for a virtual bar.

We got access to a web API with a lot of data, and had to pick and choose which data to visualize and how to do it.

My focus was on functionality instead of design, as I wanted to get javascript under my skin. 

I fetched the data with javascript and used html templates to display the data. 

In the process i have used git as version control, and worked with scss and npm packages through the terminal. 

For some of the components I have used SVG to display the data.

## Obstacles

This was my first time setting up an environment for a project and had some trouble with that.

I had problems with setting Babel up correctly, because of a function it didn't support. 

Therefore I have linked to /source/js/main.js in index.html. 

As well I couldn't get Watch up and running, so the link to my css is in /dist/css/style.css. 

The rest is linked to the dist folder.
